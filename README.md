# Arabic Writing on a Non-Linear Curve

## Description
In this repository, you will find the necessary files to run a website that can take any word written in Latin and transform it into written Arabic, adjusting it to a curve. Due to the fact that Arabic letters are often connected to each other, this feature has not existed until now. This project was developed by a digital design team and myself, addressing the lack of such features for the Arabic language.

You will also find a PDF file that goes more in depth on what we did and how we did it.

## Installation
To run this project, navigate to the **Arabic Writing** folder and run the following command in the terminal:

```bash
node server.js
```

## Usage
After starting the server, open the `svgTest` file in your browser. On the left, you will see a sidebar, and on the right, there are three sections:

- **Sidebar**: You can write the word you want in Arabic and adjust the curve on which the word will be written. The curve can be modified by adding points that describe its shape. Each point can be moved to fine-tune the curve.
- **Size Adjustment**: You can increase or decrease the size of the word relative to the curve.
- **Right Sections**: The three sections on the right will display the word in three different formats:
  1. The word on a normal straight line.
  2. The word adjusted to the curve in two different ways.

## Acknowledgments
This project was brought to me as a research assistant role and could not have been completed without the support of an amazing team. Special thanks to Dr. Amer Mouawad, my supervisor and mentor, who guided me throughout the project. Thanks also to Yara Khoury and Khajag Apelian, the digital design team that approached us to discuss how to solve this problem. Their insights and expertise were invaluable to the creation of the software.
